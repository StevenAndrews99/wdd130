      <p>
        Let me introduce myself to you! I am living in Provo Utah, having been here for almost There
        years following my return from the Florida Jacksonville Mission. I decided to move to Utah
        from my home state of California so that I could be with friends and have an opportunity to 
        go to school.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am seeking my first degree in Applied Technology. I am so excited to be on this journey and 
        to do so at an institution that reflects my values. Thus far, I've enjoyed the classes and the 
        time that I've spent learning new skills. I look forward to continuing my education and doing
        so through BYUI!
      </p>

        I currently work as a forklift driver for LiveView Technologies, and am looking forward to 
        expanding my skillset while I go to school and by seeking new opportunities in the tech space. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Between work, school, and my church calling I don't have lots of free
        time, but with the time I have I enjoy building things in my garage and
        getting outdoors for sports and recreational activities.
